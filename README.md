# GitHub Action to Purge Cloudflare Cache  üóëÔ∏è 

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** To use this action, you must have access to the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) feature. GitHub Actions are currently only available in public beta. You can [apply for the GitHub Actions beta here](https://github.com/features/actions/signup/).

This simple action calls the [Cloudflare API](https://api.cloudflare.com/#zone-purge-all-files) to purge the cache of your website, which can be a helpful last step after deploying a new version of your website.

As of now, this action will purge your *entire* zone ‚Äî in the near future, you'll be able to only purge specific files or tags.


## Usage

### `workflow.yml` Example

Place in a `.yml` file such as this one in your `.github/workflows` folder. [Refer to the documentation on workflow YAML syntax here.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)

```yaml
name: Deploy my website
on: push

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    # Put steps here to build your site, deploy it to a service, etc.

    - name: Purge cache
      uses: jakejarvis/cloudflare-purge-action@master
      env:
        CLOUDFLARE_ZONE: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_ZONE }}
        CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL }}
        CLOUDFLARE_KEY: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_KEY }}
```

If successful, you'll see the following message returned in your action's logs:

```
{"result":{"id":"***"},"success":true,"errors":[],"messages":[]}
```
